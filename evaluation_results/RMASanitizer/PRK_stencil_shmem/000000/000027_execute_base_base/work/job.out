Number of ranks        = 768
Grid size              = 192000
Radius of stencil      = 2
Tiles in x/y-direction = 24/32
Type of stencil        = star
Data type              = double precision
Compact representation of stencil loop body
Synchronization      = barrier
Number of iterations   = 1000
Solution validates
