[4bf54a6d4440:66120] Local abort after MPI_FINALIZE started completed successfully, but am not able to aggregate error messages, and not able to guarantee that all other processes were killed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 2 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 143.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.

rank 2 (of 3), pid 66122 caught signal nr 15
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[33691,1],1]
  Exit code:    1
