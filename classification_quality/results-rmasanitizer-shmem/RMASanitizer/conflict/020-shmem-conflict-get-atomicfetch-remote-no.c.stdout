[MUST] Note: MPI RMA support requires the application to be built with Clang >= 15.Executing application:
PE 0: localbuf = 0, remote = 0, 
PE 1: localbuf = 1, remote = 0, 
PE 2: localbuf = 0, remote = 0, 
Process 0: Execution finished, variable contents: remote = 0, localbuf = 0
Process 1: Execution finished, variable contents: remote = 0, localbuf = 1
Process 2: Execution finished, variable contents: remote = 0, localbuf = 0
[MUST-REPORT] MUST detected no MPI usage errors nor any suspicious behavior during this application run.
