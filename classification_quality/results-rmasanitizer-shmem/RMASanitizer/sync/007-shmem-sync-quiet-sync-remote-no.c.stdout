[MUST] Note: MPI RMA support requires the application to be built with Clang >= 15.Executing application:
PE 1: localbuf = 42, remote = 42, 
PE 0: localbuf = 1, remote = 0, 
Process 0: Execution finished, variable contents: remote = 0, localbuf = 1
Process 1: Execution finished, variable contents: remote = 42, localbuf = 42
