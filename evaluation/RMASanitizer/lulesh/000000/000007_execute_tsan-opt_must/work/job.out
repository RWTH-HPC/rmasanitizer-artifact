[MUST] Note: MPI RMA support requires the application to be built with Clang >= 15.Executing application:
# MPI communication: MPI-RMA with lock_all
# Running problem size 20^3 per domain until completion
# Num processors: 27
# Total number of elements: 216000 

To run other sizes, use -s <integer>.
To run a fixed number of iterations, use -i <integer>.
To run a more or less balanced region set, use -b <integer>.
To change the relative costs of regions, use -c <integer>.
To print out progress, use -p
To write an output file for VisIt, use -v
See help (-h) for more options
